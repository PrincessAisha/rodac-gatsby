              Our clients invest in facilities that are capital intensive, hence
              facilities that can stand the test of time should be guaranteed.
              These facilities include homes, offices, warehouses, factories,
              schools, and other social amenities. The quality of construction
              materials and consumables are a great determiner of the useful
              life span of a facility. Rodac engineering works to produce and
